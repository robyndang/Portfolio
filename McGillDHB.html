              McGill School of Architecture wanted to visualize housing characteristics, specifically affordability,
              energy, and carbon, to foster a circular economy. When materials and buildings are used for as long as
              possible, waste is reduced, and sustainability is achieved creating a circular economy.

              In order for homebuilders, financiers, and policymakers to make decisions that progress Canada towards a
              circular economy, robust building data is required. Unfortunately, building data is scattered across
              industries, lacks standardization, and is difficult to understand.

            <h3>
              The Objective
            </h3>
            <p>
              Research, strategize, and design a web experience that provides organized, standardized, and
              comprehensible data visualizations about Canada’s housing characteristics. Key decision makers will be
              able to reference building data, and evaluate their own, to forge a sustainable housing future.

            Basic Information: Ashley Cho is an architect in the homebuilding user group. She is 35 years old and is located in Montreal, Quebec. 
            Quote: I want to design buildings that inspire others to adopt greener practices.
            About: Ashley is an innovative architect with a deep commitment to designing sustainable buildings with repurposable and recycled materials. She values accurate and standardized data that increases the efficiency of her design process, and helps her achieve her ultimate goal: to contribute to a circular economy that leaves a positive impact on communities and the environment.
            Goals: 
            - Needs access to housing data that is standardized and reliable making for a more efficient design process.
            - Needs a way to understand and compare the sustainability of materials.
            - Wants to compare the sustainability of existing houses to inspire her own projects.
            - Wants a convenient way to iterate building designs and compare their sustainability.
            Frustrations:
            - Wastes time gathering and standardizing data from multiple sources.
            - Finds it challenging to receive funding and stakeholder buy-in without case studies and proof of concepts to reference.">

            Quote: I want to enable sustainable home building through financing, but first, I need to understand the circular economy.
            About: Dave is an experienced financial analyst working at one of the top banks in Canada. Housing and sustainability are relatively new concepts for him, but he is eager to understand the circular economy. He is hoping to incorporate green financing models that will forge a more affordable and sustainable housing future.
            Goals: 
            - Needs to understand the circular economy’s implications on affordable housing. 
            - Needs comprehensible data to include green targets in internal property assessments and mortgage assessments. 
            - Wants to enable risk reduction and future-proofing to boost investor confidence in the development of circular economy financing initiatives. 
            - Wants to offer favorable financing rates for energy-efficient, low-carbon emission homes.
            Frustrations: 
            - Can’t understand the complex and highly academic documents about sustainable housing. 
            - Doesn’t have case studies or proof of concepts to prove to investors sustainable housing is more cost-effective in the long run.">

            Quote: I'm determined to align our city's housing policies with global sustainability goals and reduce carbon emissions effectively.
            About: Karen is an elected City Council Member in her community with a background in urban planning and public policy. Her current focus is on facilitating policy making and creating incentives to cut carbon emissions, monitor energy performance indicators, incentivize affordable housing, and support the alignment of building information with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
            Goals: 
            - Needs to access comprehensive information about housing projects in her community. 
            - Wants to create incentives for developers and builders to prioritize sustainability in their projects while keeping housing costs accessible for residents.
            - Wants to better support the asset management of government-owned housing. Understanding the potential for reuse and circularity of building materials at the end of their lifecycle will help her make informed decisions on public property management.
            Frustrations:
            - Doesn’t have time to thoroughly research and gather information from multiple sources to make well-informed housing policy decisions.
            - Encounters resistance in implementing ambitious sustainability goals and incentives due to budget constraints and the need for public buy-in.

                    The page structure follows the same format as the housing passport so users don’t need to relearn a
                    new
                    page layout. To help users find related materials, a carousel at the bottom of the page displays
                    items
                    based on related use case and material category.

                    The client requested a supplier map, which promotes buying materials locally, but budget constraints
                    prevented us from building it. As a solution, we redirect users to prefilled Google Map searches,
                    which
                    offers better search functionality anyway.

            The website hasn’t launched yet, but during prototype testing, primary users unanimously praised the
            accessibility of the data sources. They found the website's greatest strength to be its dynamic nature, as
            it customizes data based on user inputs, offering personalized information for their housing projects.
            Finally, they loved the UI which sets it apart from other data-heavy academic websites.

            It’s important to handle client expectations early on to stay within budget. The client was ambitious and
            wanted a lot of features and functionality, but it was our job to explain why we should only design for
            user needs rather than wants resulting in the most impactful solution.
