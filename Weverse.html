              Weverse is a social media app that hosts multimedia content primarily from Kpop artists and fans.
              Weverse’s mission is to deepen artist and fan connections, regardless of language barriers, in the safety
              of their own online communities.

              The Problem
            </h3>
            <p>
              Weverse, marketed as a solution to language barriers between Korean artists and fans, disappoints users
              with its hit-or-miss translation feature. Despite restricting posts and comments to community members,
              online harassment persists, lacking the expected positivity that would differentiate Weverse from other
              social media platforms. Moreover, low fan-to-fan engagement causes users to swiftly check in on artists
              and exit the app.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
              The Objective
            </h3>
            <p>
              Research, strategize, and design an experience that provides accurate translations, decreases online
              harassment, and increases fan-to-fan engagement making Weverse the must-have app for fans.

              After analyzing 249 of Weverse’s top Apple app store reviews, I found reducing harassment was the most
              suggested feedback, followed by separating western artists from korean artists, and improving
              translations.

            User 1 who rated it 4 stars says 'Great app, but it's hard to get noticed plus recent...This app is fun, I just think it's really hard to get noticed. Also, I don't really understand the subscribing thing. If I subscribe to another fan, do their posts pop up in my feed more often?''
            
            User 2 rated it 1 star and wrote 'The Translation is so wrong. It would be nice if it could be corrected.'
            
            User 3 rated it 1 star and wrote 'Poorly moderated, racist users. Not only is this app poorly moderated, but the amount of reports I've done to the racist users who have said things to me as a black person on that app so far. For speaking up about black-'
            
            User 4 rated it 5 stars and wrote 'I think this app is pretty cool and helps communicate from fan to artist pretty well, though I'd love for a feature that would allow live streams as well as professional translators'
            
            A bar chart of the most suggested improvements from reviews is then displayed. The following data is ordered from most suggested to least suggested: 
            1. Reduce Harassment: 57 votes

              Goals: 
              - get replied from my favourite artists 
              - connect with other fans 
              - post interesting content to get engagement
              
              Constraints:
              - my posts get buried by other posts
              - other user posts aren't interesting enough for me to befriend them
              - I don't know what to post, and posting feels pointless anyway

              Motivations:
              - forming connections with fans and bonding over their shared interests
              - interacting with, and showing support for, my favourite artists

              Frustrations: 
              - seeing hateful posts towards artists in their own communities
              - rarely getting replies or cheers (likes)

              Says:
              - I'll never get noticed by my favourite artist
              - I have no idea what this translation means

              Thinks:
              - Weverse should be my safe space to be a fan
              - This feed is so boring. It's just a bunch of spam

              Does:
              - translations are so poor I have to switch to Twitter to see fan translations
              - spends a long time sifting through notifications because it's overwhelming

              Feels: 
              - ignored by both artists and other users
              - confused by the interface 
              - overhwlmed by irrelevant content">

                After: This feature ensures users never have to interact with online bullies again. It allows them to
                curate what they wish to see without unnecessarily reporting other users.

                Before: Users from different cultures disagreed about what should be posted on community feeds leading
                to conflict that had to be addressed by the Weverse team. Additionally, users had to trouble
                themselves
                by sifting through posts they didn’t understand. 
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                After: Users can view all content regardless of membership, but comments are restricted to community
                members only. This provides exposure to artists, while preserving the quality of users within each
                community.

                <br><br>
                After: Users can engage in community-wide discussions by participating in the daily question poll.
                Voting requires minimal effort, and users can also write responses and post to the feed. This daily
                activity motivates fans to regularly open the app, and there’s the added excitement of seeing what
                their
                artists voted for too.

                Before: Weverse uses subscriptions/subscribers instead of following/followers which is confusing for
                English speakers. Moreover, users can only see their subscriptions (who they're following).
                <br><br>
                After: The copy is changed to following/followers, and users can see their followers in case they wish

                <br><br>
                After: By allowing users to sort who they're following into lists, they can easily navigate to

                <br><br>
                After: Users can view posts from those they follow on the Following page. This way, they can view fan
                translations in a timely manner and deepen fan-to-fan connections. Knowing followers will see their
                posts will also encourage posting thoughtful content.

                Community
              </h4>
              <p>
                Before: Users were confused about how to switch between communities because the dropdown button looked
                like a verification checkmark. In addition, the profile pictures incorrectly implied users could click
                into individual artist profiles.
                <br><br>
                The UI of artist moments (stories) at the top of the community feed had text that was hard to read since
                they were on top of images, and the rectangle images didn't give users a good idea of what they'd be
                clicking into. Artist moments were also redundantly repeated in a different UI on the artist feed.
                <br><br>
                After: An image banner replaces the confusing multiple profile pictures, and one profile picture
                containing an artist’s logo is used to afford switching between artist communities.  
                <br><br>
                Only 16% of users reported using the Discover page often, so I removed it from the main navigation and
                placed a
                global community search at the top instead.
                <br><br>
                Artist moments only live on the artist feeds as it makes more sense there and allows room for the poll
                on the community feed. The UI was changed for better readibility and clarity.

                <br><br>
                After: Users can filter between Korean and International artist communities, and search for specific

                Before: Whenever artists go on a reply spree, their notifications get lost among personal activity
                notifications. As we know, users mainly check Weverse to see artist posts and interactions with other
                users. 
                <br><br>
                After: I separated the notifications into Artist and My Activity. Only 12% of users reported joining
                more than 7 communities, so it isn't overwhelming to filter by community.

                All six of the current users prefer the redesign to the original. They believe it solves the issues
                they
                had with Weverse, and stated they’d spend more time on the app if improvements were applied.

                Since this was my first ever product design project, I inevitably failed to consider some factors. If I
                could redo the usability tests, I would include a Net Promoter Score, instead of asking open ended
                questions to measure how much they liked the new features. In future projects, to have a
                clearer, and more quantifiable result of user experiences, I would choose an appropriate metric system
                in the testing phase.
