              Weverse is a social media app that hosts multimedia content primarily from Kpop artists and fans.
              Weverse’s mission is to deepen artist and fan connections, regardless of language barriers, in the safety
              of their own online communities.

            <h3>
              The Problem
            </h3>
            <p>
              Weverse, marketed as a solution to language barriers between Korean artists and fans, disappoints users
              with its hit-or-miss translation feature. Despite restricting posts and comments to community members,
              online harassment persists, lacking the expected positivity that would differentiate Weverse from other
              social media platforms. Moreover, low fan-to-fan engagement causes users to swiftly check in on artists
              and exit the app.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
              The Objective
            </h3>
            <p>
              Research, strategize, and design an experience that provides accurate translations, decreases online
              harassment, and increases fan-to-fan engagement making Weverse the must-have app for fans.

              After analyzing 249 of Weverse’s top Apple app store reviews, I found reducing harassment was the most

            Surverying Users + Insights

          <p>
            With these suggestions in mind, I created a survey and distributed it into all fan communities on Weverse.
            Initially, few responded, but with the power of memes, I managed to get 161 responses. The following
            insights stood out to me.

                Before: Many users mentioned being reported then banned from Weverse after expressing a different

                <br><br>

                to conflict that had to be addressed by the Weverse team. Additionally, users had to trouble themselves
                by sifting through posts they didn’t understand. 
                <br><br>

                Community Pages
              </h4>
              <p>
                Before: Users were confused about how to switch between communities because the dropdown button looked
                like a verification checkmark. In addition, the profile pictures incorrectly implied users could click
                into individual artist profiles. 
                <br><br>
                After: An image banner replaces the confusing multiple profile pictures, and one profile picture
                containing an artist’s logo is used to afford switching between artist communities.  
                <br><br>
                Only 16% of users reported using the Discover page often, so I removed it altogether and placed a global
                community search at the top instead. Searches are categorized into Artist Posts, Artist Comments, Media,
                Following Posts, and Fan Posts.

                Joining Communities
              </h4>
              <p>
                Before: There was no search functionality so users had to horizontally scroll through 30+ community
                cards. 
                <br><br>
                After: Users can filter between Korean and International artist communities, and search for specific
                names using the search bar.

              <h4>
                Separate Notifications
              </h4>
              <p>
                Before: Whenever artists go on a reply spree, their notifications get lost among personal activity
                notifications. As we know, users mainly check Weverse to see artist posts and interactions with other
                users. 
                <br><br>
                After: Only 12% of users reported joining more than 7 communities, so I separated notifications by
                community, and added a special section for artist-to-fan interactions.

                The ex-user participant said they would download Weverse again if these improvements were implemented.

                All six of the current users prefer the redesign to the original. They believe it solves the issues they
                had with Weverse, and stated they’d spend more time on the app if improvements were applied.
              </p>

                Both first time users found the redesign intuitive to use overall, and believed the added features would
                make for a more engaging experience.
